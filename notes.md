#### AppState

- the json which can be read from (what data structure should this be?)
- a history of the transformations
- varables (name and value and type?)
- history of commands use

#### Logic

- cli args
- data ingestion
- json validation
- possible tui commands
- formating for human reading
- storing varables
- understand the types of the data to know what transformations can be used on what data
- the UI will subscribe to state so the ui gets updates when that state changes
- search the json
- tui command sugestion/fuzzy search
- logging

#### UI

#### Mics
